////Collaboration and sources 
In this project I worked with three of my other classmates, we either met up to talk about the problems or we texted one another. It helped a lot to be able to see their thinking on everything.
We were also able to talk out our solutions and check with one another if we got the same thing
I also did use chatgpt to creating test examples to run through my code. It helped me to find if my code was actaully doing what I wanted, and I would write code and then ask it to 
create a trace of what I was doing. Then from there on my own, I would write it on my white board to trace out the rest when my code would have bugs in it. There were two instances where I did need its help really 
badly because I didn't know what else to do. I used it in member to help with catching atoms and in subset, because I need help changing my test function and I thought there was a bug in my code, but 
it really just my test cases in main that I hadn't properly implemented. 

//Implementation details 
I used car and cdr an ungodly amount of times. But, once I got past making, member, flat, and a few of the other first functions, I was able to start calling them in other functions which
made it so much easier to do my code as I didn't have to do as much work because of it. It also made it easier to catch bugs since there were already safety cases in other functions so it would immediately crash.

////Testing status 

//It is fully functional on both Clion and Blue, I made sure to triple check every single function to make sure it catches all the right cases.
